# Ball-and-Spec-Sheet-App

As an avid bowler who enjoys going to tournaments both locally, and more recently nationally, always having a list of my current balls in and out of my arsenal as well as my drilling specs readily avaiable is always great to have. With this app, I want to be able to put in my ball information in the app to always have. 

Ball information will include, but not limited to:
  1. Ball Manufacture and Name
  2. Drilling Information
  3. Ball numbers (RG and Diff)
  4. Out of box surface
  5. Current Surface
  6. Layout on the ball
  
 Drilling specs will also be included:
  1. Span
  2. Pitches
  3. Special needs for drilling
  
Want to be able to add as many balls to the app as desired and as limited by the storage capacity of the device.
